# Snake Game

This is a classic **Snake Game** written in **Python** using the **Pygame** library. The objective of the game is simple: control the snake to eat food (apples) while avoiding collisions with itself or the screen borders. As the snake eats, it grows longer, and the player's score increases.

## Features

- **Smiley Snake**: The snake's head is drawn as a smiley face, featuring round eyes, a smile, and a friendly look.
- **Apple Food**: The snake eats apples that randomly spawn on the screen. The snake grows longer each time it eats.
- **Game Over Handling**: The game ends if the snake collides with itself. Upon game over, a "Nice Try!!!" message is shown, and the player must press any key to exit the game.
- **Score and High Score**: The player's current score and the highest score ever achieved are displayed at the top of the screen.
- **Game Wraparound**: The game world wraps around. If the snake moves off one edge of the screen, it reappears on the opposite side.

## Installation
